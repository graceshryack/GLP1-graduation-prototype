## Phase Hero Cards (Home Screen)

### Phase 1 — Build Your Foundation
Medication is doing the heavy lifting right now. Use this window to build habits that will carry you forward — protein structure, movement, sleep, and glucose awareness. No pressure to be perfect.

### Phase 2 — Your Body Is Recalibrating
Appetite is returning, and that's a sign your body is adapting. Some weight regain is biologically normal. Focus on responding to hunger signals, not fighting them. The habits you built in Phase 1 are your safety net.

### Phase 3 — You Are the System Now
Medication is behind you. Your habits, awareness, and structure are what keep you stable. This 12-week graduation program will confirm you're ready — and your scores will prove it.

---

## Phase-Specific Core Principles

### Phase 1
1. Medication does the heavy lifting — use this time to build habits
2. Consistency beats perfection
3. Muscle preservation starts now
4. Learn your glucose patterns while they're stable

### Phase 2
1. Appetite return is expected — not a setback
2. Small weight regain is biologically normal
3. Habits you built in Phase 1 are your safety net
4. Trends matter more than daily numbers

### Phase 3 (Graduation)
1. You are the system now — medication is gone
2. A 3–5% regain is maintenance, not failure
3. Muscle preservation is your metabolic insurance
4. Periodic drift is normal — catch it early, correct gently

## Banners (phase-specific normalization)

### Tapering / Dose Reduction (first 14 days after dose decrease)
- **Title:** Your body is adjusting
- **Body:** As your dose decreases, appetite can return and some temporary weight regain is common. This isn't failure—your habits are now doing more work. Focus on structure and trends.

### GLP-1 Graduation (first 21 days after STOPPED)
- **Title:** Stability is success
- **Body:** It's normal to see more hunger and slightly higher post-meal glucose as digestion returns to normal speed. Your goal is consistency, not perfection.

---

## Focus cards (What to focus on this week)

### Phase 1 — Build your foundation
- Protein anchor at meals
- Meal structure even without hunger
- Start strength training
- Learn your CGM patterns

### Phase 2 — Your body is adjusting
- Appetite return is normal
- Some regain is normal
- Pair carbs with protein
- Walk after meals

### Phase 3 — Stability is success
- Maintenance band awareness
- Strength + steps
- Trend awareness
- Flexible structure (80/20)

## Hunger Check-in (Satiety Skill)

### Phase-specific framing

| Phase | Label | Message |
|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Hunger awareness | You may not feel hungry at all — medication is suppressing your appetite. Eat by structure, not feeling. Your hunger signal will return later, and when it does, you'll be ready. |
| 2 | Hunger is waking up | Your hunger is returning — this is biological, expected, and manageable. Each check-in builds your ability to recognize real hunger vs. habit. Track it to learn your patterns. |
| 3 | Hunger mastery | You own your hunger signals now. Your job is to respond at the right time, with the right food, and trust the system you've built. Satiety is a skill — and yours is getting stronger. |

### Named scale anchors

**Hunger:**
1. No signal — Not hungry at all
2. Mildly aware — Slight hunger
3. Ready to eat — Comfortably hungry (sweet spot)
4. Very hungry — Hard to focus
5. Urgent — Overly hungry

**Fullness:**
1. Still hungry — Not satisfied
2. Slightly full — Could eat more
3. Satisfied — Comfortable, ideal (target)
4. Full — Slightly too much
5. Stuffed — Uncomfortably full

### Post-submit feedback

- **High hunger:** "Higher hunger — your body is talking. This is a signal to respond to, not resist. Try a protein-first meal next, and check if sleep was short last night."
- **Low hunger (P1):** "Low hunger — medication at work. Still eat structured meals with protein — this builds the habit you'll rely on when appetite returns."
- **Low hunger (P2/3):** "Low hunger today. Keep eating by structure even when not hungry — undereating slows metabolism and costs muscle."
- **Moderate:** "Comfortably hungry — sweet spot. Your body is communicating well and you're responding at the right time."
- **Low fullness:** "Your post-meal fullness is low — try eating more slowly, starting with protein before carbs, and adding fiber-rich foods."
- **High fullness:** "You felt overly full — next time, try pausing halfway through the meal for 2 minutes."

### Rotating micro-tips (shown after each check-in)
1. Hunger at a 3 is your sweet spot — it means your body is communicating well.
2. Feeling a 4 or 5? That usually means you waited too long. Next time, eat at a 3.
3. Satiety improves with practice. Protein, fiber, and eating speed all help you feel fuller with less.
4. Hunger returning in Phase 2 is a sign your metabolism is activating — that's good.
5. Post-meal fullness of 3–4 means you nailed the portion. Over 4 means slightly too much.
6. Pair protein + fiber at every meal to extend your fullness window by 1–2 hours.
7. A 10-minute walk after eating improves both glucose and satiety signals.
8. Poor sleep raises ghrelin (hunger hormone) by ~15–20%. Prioritize sleep to manage hunger.
9. Eating slowly (20+ min per meal) lets fullness signals reach your brain before you overeat.
10. Hunger is information, not an emergency. Observe it, respond to it, don't fight it.

## Weight After GLP-1 (Phase 3 only)

- **Title:** Weight After GLP-1
- **Framing:** Some weight regain is biologically expected — it's your body recalibrating, not a failure.
- **Sub-copy:** A 3–5% regain is **maintenance**. What matters is staying within your band and stabilizing — not hitting a perfect number.
- **Above-band advice:** Your weight is above the expected range. This is a signal to tighten habits — not a reason to panic. Recommit to protein anchoring, post-meal walks, and structured meals. Gradual correction over 2–3 weeks is the goal, not a sudden crash diet.

## CGM education (phase-aware "Spikes Are Normal" framing)

### Phase 1 — Observe & Learn
- Let's learn your patterns.

### Phase 2 — Normalize & Adjust
- Slightly higher post-meal rises can happen as digestion speeds up. Try: pair carbs with protein, add fiber/volume, or a 10–15 min walk after meals.

### Phase 3 — Maintain & Prevent Drift
- Focus on trend drift: rising fasting or variability. Use reset routines—structured meals, protein anchor, walk cadence—not detox.

---

## Drift alert script
- Trend rising. Here are 3 stabilizing actions: 1) Protein anchor at next meal 2) 15 min walk 3) Check sleep and stress.

---

## Appetite return + satiety guidance (education modules)
- Covered in 34+ multi-paragraph modules across 3 difficulty tiers. Key modules: **Appetite return**, **Weight regain normalization**, **Hunger vs. emotional eating**, **Satiety mastery**, **Carb strategy**, **Understanding fullness**, **GI comfort**, **Alcohol & maintenance** (see `MODULE_BODIES` and `EDUCATION_BY_PHASE_SECTION` in code).

---

## Stopped modal (after user logs STOPPED)
- **Title:** You're now in GLP-1 Graduation
- **Body:** We've switched your phase to GLP-1 Graduation. Your plan will emphasize stability, flexible structure, and trend awareness over a 12-week graduation program. We don't provide medication advice—always work with your clinician for dosing or stopping decisions.
- **Safety:** Encourage clinician involvement for any adverse symptoms.

---

## Content rules (global)
- CGM data is feedback, not judgment.
- Trend > single event.
- Avoid punitive language ("bad", "cheat", "failure").
- Do not label foods "good/bad"; use "more stabilizing / less stabilizing".
- Hunger is a signal to respond to, not resist.
- Satiety is a skill that improves with practice.
- Weight regain during transition is biologically expected, not a personal failure.
- Never recommend crash dieting, detox, or reactive restriction. Use "gradual correction" and "structured recommitment."
